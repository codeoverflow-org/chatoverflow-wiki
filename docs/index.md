## About
What if you could **combine** the power of

- **Chat bots** like *nightbot*, *moobot* and *botler*
- **Supporting services** like *StreamElements*, *Streamlabs*, *TipeeeStream*, *Loots* and
- **Social Media** and Chat software, e.g. *Twitter*, *Discord*, *YouTube* etc.

with your interactive chat in your livestream. What if you could easily react on events, e.g.

- Automatically **share** your new subscribers on twitter
- Automatically **control** your studio's lighting colors through chat messages
- Automatically **post** an user's cheer on your minecraft server
- Automatically **upload** a youtube video with stream highlights when your stream stops

and so much more. We know, there is [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/). But sometimes, building blocks are to generic and services aren't optimized for your streaming environment.

The alternative: Develop everything by yourself and waste hundreds of hours with API-integration. We already solved this problem for you. This is **Chat Overflow**.
