The scope of this article is to serve all Chat Overflow team members when releasing a new version. As statet in [the versioning article](development/Versioning.md), this might be the case for:

- New releases (*MAJOR*): New major feature releases with (breaking) API-Updates. New major releases are alsways documented in the [milestone](https://github.com/codeoverflow-org/chatoverflow/milestones)-section of the github issue tracker.
- Feature-Upgrades (*MINOR*): Small feature upgrades, which do not require any breaking API-Updates and can be pushed earlier.
- Bugfixes / Hotfixes (*PATCH*): Updates to resolve bugs inside any part of the Chat Overflow project.

This article guides you through the process of building, deploying and releasing new Chat Overflow versions. Please read [versioning](development/Versioning.md) and [working with npm](development/Working-with-NPM.md) first and if there are any questions (or there is some information missing in the article), feel free to conact us.
