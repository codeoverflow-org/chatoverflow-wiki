## Custom markdown
The wiki uses multiple extensions and plugins that introduce custom markdown. 

Here is a list of the most important ones including links to the documentation so you can figure out how to use them:

* [Admonition](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/extensions/admonition/) - Adds block-styled side content to the documentation, for example blocks containing notes, examples, hints or warnings.  

* [Details from PyMdown Extensions](https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/extensions/details/) - Adds blocks just like the ones from Admonition but collapsible.  

* [SuperFences from PyMdown Extensions](https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/extensions/superfences/) - Allows nesting of code blocks. Also allows to highlight lines in code blocks and to create code blocks with multiple tabs for multiple languages.

If you know other extensions/plugins that could improve the wiki let us know so we can add them or add them to the mkdocs.yml and the requirements.txt yourself and create a pull request.
