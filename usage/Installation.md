This short tutorial is meant for end users of ChatOverflow and shows how to install and run the framework with all dependencies.  
If you want to set up a build environment for developing plugins or to contribute to the framework,
head over to [Build Environment](development/Setting-up-the-Build-Environment.md).

## Prerequisites

For running Chatoverflow you will need Java 8, version `1.8.0_161` or newer.  
[You can download it here.](https://www.java.com/en/download/)

## Installation

1. Head over to the [releases](https://github.com/codeoverflow-org/chatoverflow/releases/latest) tab
and download the ChatOverflow `.zip` file from the assets section of the latest release.

2. Extract the zip file. (It's clever to extract it in  a folder called chatoverflow üòâ)

3. If you are on Windows, execute `ChatOverflow.bat`. If you are on an UNIX operating system like MacOS or Linux execute `ChatOverflow.sh`.

4. Wait for the launcher to download all dependencies. ‚è≥

5. The framework will start. Have fun using it! üòÉ

6. To start the framework again, just re-execute the script (`ChatOverflow.bat` or `ChatOverflow.sh`, depending on your system). Don't worry, it won't download the dependencies again.
